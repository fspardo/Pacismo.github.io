I am a Software Engineer with a degree in Computer Science from UMass Amherst's College of Information and Computer Sciences. I had a focus on computer and database systems, software engineering, and computer networks.

I am currently working on my Master's in Information Security at Carnegie Mellon's Information and Networking Institute, looking to specialize with a certificate in Cyber Forensics and Incident Response.
